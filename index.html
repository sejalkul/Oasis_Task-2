    <h2>Biography</h2> <br>
        <p>Ratan Naval Tata (born 28 December 1937) is an Indian industrialist and former chairman of Tata Sons.
            He was also the chairman of the Tata Group from 1990 to 2012, serving also as interim chairman from October 2016
            through February 2017. He continues to head its charitable trusts. In 2008, he received the Padma Vibhushan, the
            second highest civilian honour in India, after receiving the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian honour
            in 2000. <br> <br>
        He is the son of Naval Tata, who was adopted by Ratanji Tata, son of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of the Tata Group. 
            He graduated from the Cornell University College of Architecture with a bachelor's degree in architecture, and 
            the Harvard Business School through a management course he completed in 1975. He joined Tata in 1961, where 
            he worked on the shop floor of Tata Steel. He later succeeded J. R. D. Tata's as chairman of Tata Sons upon the
            latter's retirement in 1991. Under his tenure the Tata Group acquired Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover, and Corus, in
            an attempt to turn Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business. Tata is also one of the largest 
            philanthropists in the world, having donated around 60-65% of his income to charity.
